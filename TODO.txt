TASKS:
1. Extract features:
    - Harris feature detection + feature description [Sensitivity analysis: Different path sizes]

2. Compute distance b/w all features in img1 and all in img2:
    - Use normalized correlation, euclidean distance (on normalized values)

3. Select best matches using a threshold [Sensitivity analysis: Different threshold values]

4. Apply RANSAC:
    - Do analysis blah blah
    - Find the best transformation

5. Warp img2 into im1 using the best (affine) transformation

6. Checking the accuracy:
    - Measure euc dist b/w features of img1 and of *transformed* img2
    - Sensitivity analysis is based on this result
    - Plot

7. Finish the app. Try it out on hard cases and report

TODOs:
 Improve matching
 Design experiments


TO INCLUDE IN REPORT:
1. Detection: Harris
2. Description: sift, custom
3. RANSAC: custom implementation

MEASUREMENTS:
1. RANSAC:
    - Ratio of inliers:outliers for each candidate model
    - No. of inliers and outliers, avg. residual of the inliers for the best model
    - Display location of inliers on both images (as a "matching" diagram)
    - Accuracy score: Euc distance b/w "chosen" (best-matching maybe) keypts of img1 and warped img2

MISC. TODOs:
