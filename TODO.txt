TASKS:
1. Extract features:
    - Harris feature detection + feature description [Sensitivity analysis: Different path sizes]

2. Compute distance b/w all features in img1 and all in img2:
    - Use normalized correlation, euclidean distance (on normalized values)

3. Select best matches using a threshold [Sensitivity analysis: Different threshold values]

4. Apply RANSAC:
    - Do analysis blah blah
    - Find the best transformation

5. Warp img2 into im1 using the best (affine) transformation

6. Checking the accuracy:
    - Measure euc dist b/w features of img1 and of *transformed* img2
    - Sensitivity analysis is based on this result
    - Plot

7. Finish the app. Try it out on hard cases and report
